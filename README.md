Artificially Intelligent Personal Voice Assistant who goes by the name Rasputin

I like using Siri, Cortana, any voice assistant is a cool feature for me. 
But I don't love the fact that most of the time they're mostly useless, apart from telling you what time it is or adding an alarm, there isn't much that they help with.
So, I threw together a voice assistant built by @mmirthula02 from [their repo.](https://github.com/mmirthula02/AI-Personal-Voice-assistant-using-Python)
I'm a big believer in not reinventing the wheel, so if someone else made something similar to what I need I'll build off of that.

The additions I have made allow you to open apps with voice commands, some file management stuff, and all the features mmirthula02 already had in.
But, I know everyone likes to put their files in different places, so I include examples and comments on how to do the same for any other file. 
Might not be exactly next-gen soft, but it's somewhat useful.
