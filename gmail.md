# Using Gmail to Send Reminders
### Let Rasputin tell you to get ur ~~$%&#~~ Together

I used [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-send-email/) to learn how to do this btw.

This can be a little touchy security-wise if you don't go about it safely. 
So, here is how you can use the gmail OAuth2 authrization framework to keep yourself safe and still get Rasputin's emails. 
Before we hop in, the things we'll need to do are first to get gmail authorization, then setup a secure SMTP connection, and lastly make sure the email gets to you.
But don't worry, the code is all handled, all you've gotta do is put together the codes and tell Rasputin what to send you!
